Hi, I’m Marta 🌿
:::

:::{.home-subtitle}
Environmental Data Enthusiast | Urban Planning Analyst | Storyteller with a Map
:::

:::{.highlight-box}
I work at the intersection of data, cities, and nature — analyzing patterns and creating visual stories that make information easier (and more fun!) to understand.  
Whether it's a map, chart, or a quirky dataset, I love using data to teach, explore, and inspire.
