The goal of the project was to identify underutilized land zones, optimize transportation corridors, and predict future urban infrastructure needs. This was achieved by integrating multiple datasets, performing spatial analysis using QGIS and Python, and developing actionable recommendations for urban development.\n\nKey Project Objectives:\n\nIdentify underutilized land based on zoning, density, and FAR metrics.\nOptimize transportation corridors by analyzing traffic congestion and predicting future trends.\nForecast future urban infrastructure needs considering population growth and expansion."

    "text": "Methodology\n\nStep 1: Data Integration\nI integrated over 15 GIS layers in both QGIS and Python (using GeoPandas) to create a comprehensive spatial dataset. This process included importing data related to zoning, road networks, transit stations, and population density.\n\n\nStep 2: Land Categorization\nI categorized the land into five major use zones:\n\nResidential\nCommercial\nIndustrial\nParks\nInstitutional\n\n\n\nStep 3: Identification of Underutilized Land\nUsing Floor Area Ratio (FAR) metrics, I identified 18 underutilized land parcels in key areas of Toronto. FAR is a common urban planning metric that compares the total floor area of a building to the size of the land parcel. By identifying underutilized land, I was able to recommend potential areas for rezoning and development.\n\n\nStep 4: Traffic Congestion Analysis\nI analyzed traffic congestion projections based on the current road network and predicted population growth. Using this data, I identified five major transportation corridors that would benefit from upgrades such as road widening, improved traffic signal management, and public transit enhancements.\n\n\nStep 5: Future Urban Infrastructure Needs\nBy using population projections from 2023 to 2041 and analyzing trends in land use and development, I was able to forecast future housing, utilities, and transportation infrastructure needs. This prediction will help Toronto’s city planners make informed decisions on where to allocate resources for urban development."
