This interactive educational module is designed to teach learners about common vision impairments in adults over 40. It was built as part of my digital learning design work and combines 3D visuals, scientific research, and memory-boosting quizzes.

## 🧠 Project Overview

### Topic: Common vision impairments in adults

### Features:
- Interactive eye anatomy model
- Descriptions of 4 major vision impairments
- Risk factors, corrections, and treatment options
- Multiple-choice and matching quizzes
- Accessibility-focused design

### Tools Used:
- H5P
- Blender (for 3D model)
- HTML
- Quarto

The module includes:

- Clickable eye diagram for exploring parts of the eye

- 3D embedded model to visualize how vision works

- Quizzes to reinforce learning and improve recall

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, viewers will be able to:

- Identify parts of the eye and understand the process behind vision.
- Understand what vision impairments are and identify the most common ones in adults.
- Visualize how vision impairments affect perception compared to normal vision.
- Identify common risk factors for each impairment.
- Understand ways to reduce the chances of developing impairments.
- Recognize available treatment options.

## 👁️ What Are Vision Impairments?

Visual impairment is a term for any kind of vision loss, whether it's complete blindness or partial vision loss. Some people are born with visual impairments, while others develop them later in life.

## 🧠 How Eyes Work

When light hits the retina in the back of your eye, it’s converted into electrical signals that your optic nerve sends to your brain. Your brain turns these signals into the images you see.

## 🧓 Common Vision Impairments

### 🔹 Blurred Vision (Refractive Errors)

**What is it?** A refractive error means your eye can't bend light properly, leading to blurry vision.  
- **Types**: Myopia (nearsightedness) and hyperopia (farsightedness)

- **Risk Factors**: Age, Genetics  
- **Corrections**: Glasses, Contact lenses, Refractive surgery (LASIK)

### 🔹 Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)

**What is it?** Damage to the macula, the part of the retina responsible for sharp central vision.

- **Types**: Dry form and wet form

### 🔹 Glaucoma

**What is it?** A group of diseases that damage the eye's optic nerve, often due to high eye pressure.  

- **Types**: Open-angle, Closed-angle
