A Bit About Me ðŸŒ±
:::

Iâ€™m Marta â€” an early-career data analyst with a deep interest in cities, the environment, and how data can help us understand both more clearly.

I recently completed my degree in **Biology for Health Science** at **University of Toronto**, where I focused on topics like environmental planning, spatial data, and urban systems. During that time, I discovered how much I love working with data â€” especially when I can turn it into something **educational**, **visual**, or **interactive**.

## ðŸ§° Skills & Tools

I enjoy working at the intersection of technical and creative. Some of the tools and skills Iâ€™ve picked up include:

- **Data Analysis**: R, Python (pandas, geopandas), Excel
- **Spatial Analysis & GIS**: QGIS, ArcGIS, leaflet, mapbox, geospatial packages in R/Python
- **Data Visualization**: ggplot2, matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly, Quarto, Observable
- **Web & Communication**: Quarto websites, Markdown, GitHub Pages
- **Soft Skills**: Communication, visual thinking, creativity, public speaking

## ðŸ“š How I Think About Data

For me, data is more than numbers â€” itâ€™s a tool for **curiosity, learning, and storytelling**.  
I enjoy:
- Turning raw data into **maps or visualizations** that teach something new
- Exploring questions about **urban systems, accessibility, nature, and planning**
- Making data **approachable** through design, graphics, and clear explanations

## ðŸŒ¿ Outside the Dataset

When I'm not coding or mapping, youâ€™ll likely find me:
- Out **birdwatching** with my binoculars
- Exploring parks or city trails
- Sketching out ideas for **interactive explainers**
- Thinking about how to make information more joyful to learn

I'm always open to collaborations that blend **data, design, and curiosity** â€” especially projects related to sustainability, urban life, and environmental education.
