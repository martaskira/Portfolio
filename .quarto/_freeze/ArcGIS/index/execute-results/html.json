The goal of the project was to identify underutilized land zones, optimize transportation corridors, and predict future urban infrastructure needs. This was achieved by integrating multiple datasets, performing spatial analysis using QGIS and Python, and developing actionable recommendations for urban development.\n\n### Key Project Objectives:\n- **Identify underutilized land** based on zoning, density, and FAR metrics.\n- **Optimize transportation corridors** by analyzing traffic congestion and predicting future trends.\n- **Forecast future urban infrastructure needs** considering population growth and expansion.\n\n## Data Sources\nFor this analysis, I used the following datasets:\n\n- **Satellite imagery** of Toronto (2023) for land cover and built-up areas.\n\n- **City zoning GIS layers** for categorizing land into residential, commercial, industrial, parks, and other zones.\n\n- **Road network datasets** to assess traffic flow and congestion.\n\n- **Public transit stop locations (TTC)** to understand access to public transport.\n\n- **Population projections** (2023–2041) to predict future urban growth and infrastructure needs.\n\n## Methodology\n\n### Step 1: **Data Integration**\nI integrated over 15 GIS layers in both QGIS and Python (using GeoPandas) to create a comprehensive spatial dataset. This process included importing data related to zoning, road networks, transit stations, and population density.\n\n### Step 2: **Land Categorization**\nI categorized the land into five major use zones:\n\n- **Residential**\n\n- **Commercial**\n\n- **Industrial**\n\n- **Parks**\n\n- **Institutional**\n\n### Step 3: **Identification of Underutilized Land**\nUsing Floor Area Ratio (FAR) metrics, I identified 18 underutilized land parcels in key areas of Toronto. FAR is a common urban planning metric that compares the total floor area of a building to the size of the land parcel. By identifying underutilized land, I was able to recommend potential areas for rezoning and development.\n\n### Step 4: **Traffic Congestion Analysis**\nI analyzed traffic congestion projections based on the current road network and predicted population growth. Using this data, I identified five major transportation corridors that would benefit from upgrades such as road widening, improved traffic signal management, and public transit enhancements.\n\n### Step 5: **Future Urban Infrastructure Needs**\nBy using population projections from 2023 to 2041 and analyzing trends in land use and development, I was able to forecast future housing, utilities, and transportation infrastructure needs. This prediction will help Toronto's city planners make informed decisions on where to allocate resources for urban development.\n\n## Key Findings\n- **22% potential increase** in land-use efficiency by rezoning underutilized land.\n- **35% projected reduction** in traffic congestion by improving transportation infrastructure.\n- Priority areas for future development were identified, along with the need for additional **green spaces** and **public parks** in high-density areas.\n\n## Visualizing the Data\n\n### **Population Density Heatmap**\nHere is a heatmap showing population density across Toronto, highlighting areas where urban development should be prioritized.\n\n\n\n<iframe src=\"population_density_heatmap.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500px\"></iframe>\n\n## Traffic Congestion Reduction\nThis bar chart visualizes the projected reduction in traffic congestion for key transportation corridors after proposed upgrades.\n\n::: {#d20550d6 .cell fig-height='4' fig-width='6' execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Traffic Congestion Reduction After Proposed Upgrades](index_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.png){width=663 height=470}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Proposed Land Use Distribution\nThe donut chart below illustrates the proposed land-use distribution after optimization. The focus is on creating a balance between residential, commercial, and green spaces.\n\n::: {#c246af99 .cell fig-height='4' fig-width='6' execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Proposed Land Use Distribution After Optimization](index_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-1.png){width=555 height=411}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Proposed Solutions\nBased on the analysis, the following solutions have been proposed to address Toronto’s urban planning and land use needs:\n\n- Mixed-Use Developments: Combining residential, commercial, and green spaces in high-density areas to improve land use efficiency.\n\n- Public Transit Expansion: Building new transit lines and expanding existing ones to reduce traffic congestion and improve accessibility.\n\n- Public Parks Development: Creating more parks in densely populated areas to provide green spaces for residents and improve quality of life.\n\n- Road Widening & Traffic Signal Optimization: Expanding key roads and optimizing traffic flow in critical corridors to reduce congestion.\n\n## Conclusion\nThis project demonstrates how data-driven analysis and GIS tools can significantly contribute to urban planning and land use optimization. By focusing on underutilized land, enhancing transportation networks, and forecasting future needs, we can make more informed decisions that will improve Toronto's infrastructure and the quality of life for its residents.\n\n",
